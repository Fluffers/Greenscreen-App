# Greenscreen App

My first attempt with windows apps, also a final project for python course. 

It's a simple window app showing the ability to remove background from a video and put an image instead. It works by cutting out pixiels with specific color and overwriting them with provided image. 

works with python 3.8.2 and opencv package. 

# How to run it

- Use python 3.8.2
- Install opencv package
- Make sure your python installation comes with Tcl/Tk
